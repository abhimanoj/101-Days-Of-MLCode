# Numpy:-
* NumPy is a very popular python library for large multi-dimensional array and matrix processing, 
* with the help of a large collection of high-level mathematical functions. It is very useful for 
* fundamental scientific computations in Machine Learning. It is particularly useful for linear 
* algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities. High-end libraries like TensorFlow 
* uses NumPy internally for manipulation of Tensors.
